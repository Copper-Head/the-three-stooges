	\textbf{motivation:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item as well as in the word-level experiment we need to explore a way to find out about neuron groups correlating with input-specific phenomena		
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{procedure:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item we used PCA to find the neurons explaining between 90 and 99\% of the activation variation in a 1-layered simple recurrent ($H=1024$)
		\item after that, we correlated word bounderies and sequence length on the remaining components
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{\expvii}
	\textbf{results:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item dimensionality was reduced on $\approx 500$
		\item sequence length correlation decreased  
		\item word boundery correlation decreased on \texttt{0.3} (\texttt{0.6} without PCA)
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{conclusion:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item PCA failed
		\item we were using a linear reduction method on clearly non-linear data
		\item this motivates E10
	\end{itemize}
